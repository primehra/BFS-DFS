TestData.java
This class can be used to test the BFS and DFS classes. Already created in the main are an instance of BFS and an
instance of DFS which can then be used to test various other methods in those classes, as shown in lines 8-9.
----------------------------------------------------
DFS.java
DFS is automatically implemented when an instance of this class is created. So the only thing that needs to be
separately run is the printDiscovered method, if needed.
----------------------------------------------------
BFS.java
Similar to DFS, BFS is automatically implemented when an instance of this class is created. However, there are many
other supplementary methods to give more insight into the results.

ReadData.java
ReadData takes in a source path and creates adjacency matrix from the given file.
